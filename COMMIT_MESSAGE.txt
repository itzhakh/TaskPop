feat: Switch to light theme for improved accessibility and readability

- Activate light theme by setting data-theme="light" on document root
- Utilizes existing light theme CSS variables in styles/theme.css
- Improves contrast ratios and accessibility compliance
- Provides better user experience in well-lit environments

The light theme was already defined in the CSS but not activated.
This change simply enables it application-wide from app initialization.

Changes:
- src/main.js: Add theme activation with documentation comments
